# TMF Billing Management API RI

## Introduction

This is the code repository for the reference implementation of the TM Forum Billing Management API, used as part of
the FIWARE/TMForum Business API Ecosystem.

## API Overview

The Billing Management API provides standardized mechanisms for billing account, bill item and settlement note
advice management either in B2B or B2B2C contexts.

It allows creation, update and retrieval of a billing account either in a B2B2C relationship context
(creation of mass market customer billing account within a “Billing on Behalf of” process for example) or in
a B2B context (creation of a billing account for a partner or B2B customer). It also allows creation and query
of bill items allowing partners or B2B customer to check their invoice.

For more details on the structure of the TMF Billing Management API have a look at its [page in TM Forum site](https://www.tmforum.org/resources/standard/tmf636-billing-management-api-rest-specification-r14-5-0/)
